# BHoM Governance 


The development of the Buildings and Habitats object Model is led by a number of core maintainers within the BHoM Organisation. These individuals and their focuses are listed below.

Contributions are very welcome and warmly encouraged either from outside of the organisation, as a collaborator added to individual repositories or alternatively from any individual's created branches or forks.

The current core maintainers are listed below, however we are actively interested in other members joining to expand and support further at every level. If interested please get in touch. You can do this through contacting individual maintainers or emailing hello@bhom.xyz or simply raising issues or submitting code. 


If you should have any queries around best practices in contributing or commenting on code, issues, PRs etc. please see our [Code of Conduct document here](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Organisation Maintainers 

The current maintainers for the parent BHoM organisation are:  

  &nbsp;  @al-fisher  
  &nbsp;  @rwemay  
  &nbsp;  @adecler  

In addition to the typical activities of a repository maintainer across the many individual repos, the Organisation Maintainers work with the core developers to set the longer term development objectives, technical direction, project governance and process for the wider BHoM project and framework.

## Repository or Namespace Maintainers 


#### Repository Maintainer Activities
Typical activities of a Repository Maintainer include:

* Helping users and novice contributors  
* Contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project  
* Reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests  
* Merging pull requests  
* Supporting both testing and any releases of code


A number of the key repositories and/or individual namespaces are summarised below. However for more detail on individual responsibilities for code within repos please refer to the local CODEOWNERS documents.
In particular, for granular breakdown for the Core Repositories see direct links [BHoM Repository Code Owners](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/master/docs/CODEOWNERS) and [BHoM_Engine Repository Code Owners](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_Engine/blob/master/docs/CODEOWNERS).

## Decision making 

The Buildings and Habitats object Model operates on a fully open and community led governance model. We benefit from a hugely rich diversity of contributions, with individuals sharing deep domain know-how, as well as taking responsibility for maintainance and leading areas of development.

We believe in the widest possible active community. Thus all decision making is carried out collectively, with agreement reached through discussion and consensus. This includes all planning, technical objective setting and code reviews.

In the unlikely and rare event that consensus is not reached on any thread - deadlock is broken and a decision is made by voting across the group of maintainers. Tie-breaking may be provided by organisation maintainers only when needed.

In all cases we endeavour to transparently document all decision making and logic in the issue and pull request threads as a matter of record.
