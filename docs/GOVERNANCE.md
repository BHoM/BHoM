# BHoM Governance 


The development of the BHoM is led by a number of core maintainers within the BHoM Organisation. These individuals and their focuses are listed below.

Contributions are very welcome and warmly encouraged either from outside of the organisation as a collaborator added to individual repositories or alternatively from any individual's created forks.

The current core maintainers are listed below, however we are actively interested in other members joining to expand and support further at every level. If interested please do reach out. You can do this through contacting individual maintainers or emailing hello@bhom.xyz or simply raising issues or submitting code. 


If you should have any queries around best practices in contributing or commenting on code, issues, PRs etc. please see our Code of Conduct document [here](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Organisation Maintainers 

The current maintainers for the parent BHoM organisation are:  

  &nbsp;  @al-fisher  
  &nbsp;  @rwemay  
  &nbsp;  @adecler  

In addition to the typical activities of a repository maintainer across the many individual repos, the Organisation Maintainers work with the core developers to set the longer term development objectives, technical direction, project governance and process for the wider BHoM project and framework.

## Repository or Namespace Maintainers 


#### Repository Maintainer Activities
Typical activities of a Repository Maintainer include:

* Helping users and novice contributors  
* Contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project  
* Reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests  
* Merging pull requests  
* Supporting both testing and any releases of code


The repositories and/or individual namespaces are summarised below. However, for more detail on individual responsibilities for code within repos please refer to the local CODEOWNERS documents.
In particular, for granular breakdown for the Core Repositories see direct links [BHoM Repository Code Owners](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/master/docs/CODEOWNERS) and [BHoM_Engine Repository Code Owners](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_Engine/blob/master/docs/CODEOWNERS).
