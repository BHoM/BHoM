# BHoM Code of Conduct
The BHoM is a collective experiment with diverse contributions not only hugely valued but integral to the project itself.  
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.   
  




## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language.
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
*   Being open to and gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
*   Focusing on what is best for the community.
*   Being mindful of the lack of context that is very often the case in online platforms.
*   Showing empathy towards other community members.


Wholly professional interactions are expected across all BHoM forums and spaces, thus any behavior which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting is unacceptable.


## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all content on https://github.com/bhom, https://bhom.slack.com/, https://bhom.xyz or any other official BHoM web presence that might allow for community interactions.

The Code of Conduct also applies within project spaces and in public spaces whenever an individual is representing BHoM or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed or de facto representative at an online or offline event. 


## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts in an open source project can take many forms, from someone having a bad day and using harsh and hurtful language in the issue queue, to more serious instances such as sexist/racist statements or threats of violence, and everything in between.

If the behavior is threatening or harassing, or for other reasons requires immediate escalation, please see below.

However, for the vast majority of issues, we aim to empower individuals to first resolve conflicts themselves, asking for help when needed, and only after that fails, to escalate further. This approach gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. 

If you are experiencing or witnessing conflict, we ask you to consider the following escalation strategy to address the conflict:

1.  Address the perceived conflict directly with those involved, considering the standards above, and preferably in a real-time medium,
2.  If this fails, get a third party (e.g. a mutual friend, and/or someone with
    background on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede,
3. If the above is not successful, with the conflict still unresolved, and you believe it rises to
    harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it.



## Reporting Violations and Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [admin@bhom.xyz](admin@bhom.xyz). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the projectâ€™s leadership.
