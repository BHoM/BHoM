# BHoM Code of Conduct for Bots
If you are looking for the Code of Conduct for human contributors to the BHoM framework please refer to the version  [here](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).   

The following guidelines are designed with reference to (but whose scope is not limited to) the defined use of @BHoMBot and other bots as part of BHoM continuous integration, continuous delivery and automation of coding support and maintenance. 


## Bot Behaviour 

Bots posting comments, messages or reporting across any BHoM GitHub Organisation or associated platform should follow the guidelines below: 

*   Comments from bots should remain objective, documenting events and factual status reports.
*   Bots should not express opinions - including re-posting or perpetuating comments from other users.
*   Any language adopted by bots must adhere to the exact same values as outlined in our [standard code of conduct](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 
*   Bots may ask closed, specific questions, to which a positive response may trigger a further interaction or a series of well documented, automated events.
*   Bot responses should be logical, consistent and conform to a user's general expectations regardless of documentation. Surprises or causing confusion is bad.
*   A bot can not modify another author's Branch or raised Pull Request unless directly instructed by an authorized user. 


Authorized users in this context will refer to:
a) Issue/PR Author
b) Code Owner
c) Administrators and Maintainers  

For more details on code roles and governance see document [here](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/master/docs/GOVERNANCE.md).


As with _any_ remote and online dialogue these rules are designed to be explicitly mindful of the inherent lack of contextual information. 
The BHoM community aims for bot interaction with other users to be in direct support of a more efficient and effective code review and continuous integration processes.

## User Interactions with Bots

Any communication with bots must meet the exact same expectations as outlined in our [standard code of conduct](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and are subject to enforcement in the same way. 

## Bots and CI

As part of our approach to continuous integration (CI), @BHoMBot and other bots may assist with tasks alongside other automated procedures across the categories of:

- Compilation checks
- Compliance checks 
- Unit and macro testing


Absolute responsibility - quality, robustness and ensuring that any code is fit for purpose - remains the duty of the code authors, reviewers and development community at large.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct for Bots applies to all automatically generated or posted content on https://github.com/bhom, https://bhom.slack.com/, https://bhom.xyz or any other official BHoM web presence that might allow for community interactions between humans and bots.



## Feedback, Reporting Bugs and Unexpected Behaviour

Reporting issues or questions related to @BHoMBot and other automated governance/compliance procedures can be directed to the organisation maintainers
