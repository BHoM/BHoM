# BHoM
Buildings and urban Habitats common Object Model

There have been some fairly major updates to the BHoM project recently, to make it more flexible for future development. 

### Build BHoM from Source ###
You will need the following to build BHoM:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or higher
- [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 and above (included with Visual Studio 2013)
- Note that there are no software - specific dependencies (only operating system relevant), this is specific: BHoM is a software agnostic object model.

## Contribute ##

BHoM is a BuroHappold open-source project and would be nothing without its community.  You can submit your own code to the BHoM project via a Github [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
