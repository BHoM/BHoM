# Core BHoM Repo

This repo is part of the Buildings and Habitats object Model. 
If you are new (_welcome!_  ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜„)  a great place to start is on [bhom.xyz](https://bhom.xyz) and reading our [documentation](https://bhom.xyz/documentation), including our [Getting Started Pages](https://bhom.xyz/documentation/Basics/Using-the-BHoM/).

This particular repo contains all of the core _object Model_ (oM) definitions. Our community curated common language.

The objects themselves are designed to be very simple, and therefore flexible and customisable. Comprising of nothing more than a list of defining properties. See [defining objects in the oM](https://bhom.xyz/documentation/BHoM_oM/) for more details.

The core BHoM contains objects from wide ranging domains across the disciplines of engineering, architecture, our environment and the physical world, as well as defining concepts within programming, machine learning, mathematics, geometry and planning to name a few.

Along with the rest of the core repositories - [BHoM_Engine](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_Engine), [BHoM_Adapter](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_Adapter) and [BHoM_UI](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_UI) â€“ this is the basis on which all of the BHoM Toolkits are built.

## Quick Start ðŸš€ 

Grab the [latest installer](https://bhom.xyz/) and a selection of [sample scripts](https://github.com/BHoM/samples).


## Getting Started for Developers ðŸ¤– 

If you want to build the BHoM and the Toolkits from source, it's hopefully easy! ðŸ˜„ 
Do take a look at our specific wiki pages here: [Getting Started for Developers](https://bhom.xyz/documentation/Guides-and-Tutorials/Coding-with-BHoM/).
