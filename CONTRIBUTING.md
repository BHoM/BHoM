# Contributing to the BHoM

Great to see you here! :smile: There are a number of ways to contribute and get involved in the Buildings and Habitats object Model (the BHoM). Please do take a read and reach out if curious to join in with our collective experiment. [hello@bhom.xyz](mailto:hello@bhom.xyz)  
Check out our [wiki](https://bhom.xyz/documentation/) too for more info about the BHoM and how it works.

Do also take a look at our [code of conduct](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (_we also have one for [bots too](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT_FOR_BOTS.md) if that is you?_ :+1: :robot:)


## Get stuck in

- Submit an issue

  Found a bug? :bug: Have an idea for a feature? :brain: Why not [submit an issue](https://bhom.xyz/documentation/Contributing/Submitting-an-Issue/)?

- Contribute code

  Want to hack? :computer: Know how to fix an open issue? Branch :palm_tree: or Fork :fork_and_knife: away and feel free to raise a Pull Request to start a conversation. [See resolving an issue](https://bhom.xyz/documentation/Contributing/Resolving-an-Issue/)!



## Other ways to contribute

- Just get involved in the community 

  Even if you do not have code to contribute you can still get involved. Join the discussion on existing issues and pull requests, or open a new question issue to ask about any aspect of the BHoM code or toolkits.  
  Also do feel free to ask questions or join the conversation on [BHoM discussions](https://github.com/orgs/BHoM/discussions) :mega:

- Contribute documentation

  Know some details that are not documented? Think that the documentation that is there is lacking detail? Got an example or tutorial you would like to share? :mortar_board: [See editing the documentation]https://bhom.xyz/documentation/Contributing/Editing-the-documentation/) and submit pull requests related to documentation too. If you've published some samples or tutorials somewhere else online, let us know! 


- Suggest a new Toolkit

  Use an application that does not already have a BHoM Adapter? 
  Reach out on [https://github.com/orgs/BHoM/discussions](https://github.com/orgs/BHoM/discussions/categories/ideas) and let us and others know what you'd like to see. :raising_hand:

- Building a new BHoM Toolkit yourself?

    We'd love to hear from you as we may wish to help you maintain it. :construction:

## Get even more involved

As a free software project anybody can contribute to the BHoM or create their own derivatives. The roadmaps and development objectives for the core BHoM is primarily maintained by a group of Core Maintainers who form the [BHoM Governance Organisation](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM/blob/master/docs/GOVERNANCE.md). This group is open to anyone willing and able, with contributions warmly encouraged as detailed in our governance document. 

If you might be interested in becoming listed as a Core Maintainer please [contact us at hello@bhom.xyz](mailto:hello@bhom.xyz)

We will be excited to hear from you!
